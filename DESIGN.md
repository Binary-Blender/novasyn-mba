# NovaSyn MBA — Design Document

## Overview

Solo founders running multiple businesses face a specific failure mode: each business lives in its own mental and operational silo. The strategy work done for one never informs the next. The audience built in one is never levered into another. The lessons learned from a failed product never get codified for the new one.

NovaSyn MBA is a portfolio OS — a single desktop application that holds every business a solo founder runs or is considering, tracks each one across its full lifecycle, and surfaces connections across the portfolio that no single-business view can see.

The app is organized around the seven disciplines of the solo-founder MBA: Strategy, Operations, Finance, Marketing, Sales, Technology, and Leadership. Each discipline has a dedicated AI advisor. Every advisor uses the frameworks from *The One-Person Enterprise* — the $20/$200 Audit, the authority ladder, the unit economics dashboard, the compounding moat model — not generic business advice.

**Who it is for**: Solo founders and micro-teams (1-3 people) running multiple revenue streams or business experiments simultaneously.

**What it is not**: A project management tool. A CRM. A spreadsheet replacement. It is a structured thinking environment for the CEO role — the part that most solo founders skip because there is no system holding them accountable to it.

---

## Core Philosophy

### 1. AI Disciplines What Humans Cannot Maintain

A solo founder cannot reliably review their own strategy every week. They cannot objectively assess their own sales pipeline hygiene. They cannot notice when their unit economics have silently degraded. The seven AI advisors exist to enforce the cadence and objectivity of the MBA disciplines without requiring the founder to hire a team.

The Cattle Dog Principle applies throughout: AI never sets direction. It surfaces information, flags problems, and offers options. The human decides. Every AI advisor output is framed as a briefing, not a mandate.

### 2. Deterministic Systems Track What AI Reasons About

AI advisors are only as good as the data they can see. The entity model is designed to make the right data easy to capture and impossible to fudge. Stage gates require specific data before a business can advance. The $20/$200 Audit cannot be "completed" without classifying every logged task. Unit economics cannot be flagged as healthy unless the numbers are actually entered.

Sovereign Intelligence means the founder owns the thinking. The system owns the accountability. Neither replaces the other.

### 3. Portfolio View Surfaces Synergies No Single-Business Lens Can See

The portfolio synergy detector is the feature that cannot exist in a single-business tool. It scans all businesses simultaneously and asks: are there two businesses in this portfolio that share an audience but have never cross-promoted? Are there two businesses that use the same underlying technology stack that could be consolidated? Is there content produced for one business that would generate authority for another?

This is the Compounding Operator in action: building assets (audiences, systems, content, relationships) that work across multiple businesses simultaneously.

## Entity Model

### Business

The top-level portfolio entry. Every other entity belongs to a Business.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| name | TEXT | Required. The business name. |
| tagline | TEXT | One-line value proposition. |
| description | TEXT | Longer description for internal reference. |
| stage | TEXT | Enum: Idea / Validated / Building / Active / Scaling / Exited / Paused / Killed |
| category | TEXT | e.g. Consulting, SaaS, Course, Community, Content, Physical Product |
| market_niche | TEXT | The specific market segment being served. |
| business_model | TEXT | How money is made: retainer / productized / subscription / one-time / hybrid |
| revenue_target | REAL | Annual revenue goal in USD. |
| launch_date | DATE | Nullable. When the business went live. |
| exit_date | DATE | Nullable. When the founder exited or killed the business. |
| notes | TEXT | Freeform CEO journal for this business. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Relationships**: has many StrategicPosition, OperationsAudit, DollarAudit, FinancialSnapshot, MarketingAsset, SalesContact, ContentPipelineItem, AIStackDecision, WeeklyReview. Referenced by PortfolioSynergy (as business_a or business_b).

**Design note**: Stage is a COMPILER state machine. See Business Lifecycle section.

---

### StrategicPosition

The strategic analysis for a business. Typically one active record per business, updated as strategy evolves.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| business_id | INTEGER FK | References Business |
| target_market | TEXT | Specific description of the customer being served. |
| value_proposition | TEXT | What problem is solved, for whom, and why this solution. |
| primary_moat | TEXT | Enum: reputation / system / network / content |
| competitors | TEXT | JSON array of competitor descriptions. |
| unfair_advantages | TEXT | What the founder has that competitors cannot easily copy. |
| moat_score | INTEGER | Self-assessed 1-10 moat strength. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**The four moats** (from the textbook): Reputation (trust built over time), System (proprietary process or methodology), Network (relationships and community), Content (body of work that compounds).

---

### OperationsAudit

The six-bottleneck blueprint audit. Identifies where the business is operationally constrained.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| business_id | INTEGER FK | References Business |
| knowledge_bottleneck | INTEGER | Score 1-5. Is the founder the only one who knows how things work? |
| quality_bottleneck | INTEGER | Score 1-5. Is the founder the quality gate for all output? |
| coordination_bottleneck | INTEGER | Score 1-5. Does everything route through the founder to coordinate? |
| communication_bottleneck | INTEGER | Score 1-5. Is the founder the sole voice of the business externally? |
| creative_bottleneck | INTEGER | Score 1-5. Does all creative work require the founder's involvement? |
| decision_bottleneck | INTEGER | Score 1-5. Can nothing be decided without the founder? |
| overall_score | INTEGER | Computed: sum of the six scores. Lower is better (6=fully systemized, 30=fully bottlenecked). |
| audit_date | DATE | When this audit was conducted. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Design note**: The operations advisor reads this entity and identifies the highest-scoring bottleneck as the highest-leverage target for systemization.

---

### DollarAudit

The $20/$200 Audit — every task the founder performs, classified by value tier.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| business_id | INTEGER FK | References Business |
| activity_name | TEXT | What the task is. |
| tier | TEXT | Enum: twenty / two_hundred |
| hours_per_week | REAL | How many hours per week this task currently consumes. |
| ai_transferable | INTEGER | Boolean. Can AI take this over? |
| transfer_status | TEXT | Enum: not_started / in_progress / transferred |
| notes | TEXT | Freeform. What the transfer plan is, or why it cannot be transferred. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**$20 tier**: Execution tasks — scheduling, formatting, research, data entry, transcription, social posting, inbox triage.  
**$200 tier**: Judgment tasks — client diagnosis, strategic positioning, offer design, relationship management, creative direction.

The audit goal is to transfer as many $20 tasks as possible to AI or systems, freeing the founder for $200 work.

---

### FinancialSnapshot

A point-in-time unit economics capture. Designed to be recorded monthly or quarterly.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| business_id | INTEGER FK | References Business |
| period | TEXT | e.g. "2026-Q1" or "2026-05" |
| revenue | REAL | Total revenue for the period. |
| cac | REAL | Customer Acquisition Cost. Total sales/marketing spend ÷ new customers. |

| ltv_cac_ratio | REAL | Computed: LTV ÷ CAC. Target: > 3. Red flag: < 2. |
| gross_margin_pct | REAL | Gross profit as a percentage of revenue. |
| mrr | REAL | Monthly Recurring Revenue. 0 for non-subscription businesses. |
| cash_runway_months | REAL | Months of operating expenses covered by current cash. Target: > 6. |
| recorded_at | DATETIME | When this snapshot was taken. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Key thresholds** (from the textbook): LTV:CAC < 2 = acquisition model is broken. Gross margin < 50% = not a scalable business. Cash runway < 6 months = existential risk. MRR > $10K = proof of recurring demand.

---

### MarketingAsset

An authority-building asset. Tracks the content and social proof that moves the founder up the authority ladder.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| business_id | INTEGER FK | References Business |
| asset_type | TEXT | Enum: content / testimonial / case_study / social_proof |
| title | TEXT | Name or description of the asset. |
| url | TEXT | Nullable. Link to the published asset. |
| platform | TEXT | Where it lives: website, LinkedIn, YouTube, podcast, etc. |
| published_at | DATE | When it was published. |
| authority_stage_impact | TEXT | Which authority ladder stage this asset serves: unknown→aware / aware→credible / credible→authoritative / authoritative→referred |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Authority ladder** (from the textbook): Unknown → Aware → Credible → Authoritative → Referred. Each stage requires different content types: Unknown→Aware needs reach content; Credible→Authoritative needs depth content and case studies; Authoritative→Referred needs referral systems and community presence.

---

### SalesContact

A prospect or client in the sales pipeline.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| next_action_date | DATE | When to take that action. |
| notes | TEXT | Conversation history and context. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Design note**: The qualification gate (Prospect → Qualified) is a key leverage point. The sales advisor flags contacts that have been in prospect for more than 14 days without a qualification conversation.

---

### ContentPipelineItem

A single piece of content moving through the production pipeline.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |

| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Design note**: The content-to-client pipeline is the engine of authority-first marketing. Tracking inbound leads per piece gives the marketing advisor data to recommend which content formats and platforms are actually converting.

---

### AIStackDecision

A record of each build/buy/automate decision for a specific capability.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |
| business_id | INTEGER FK | References Business |
| capability | TEXT | What the capability is (e.g. "email marketing", "proposal generation", "client onboarding"). |
| decision | TEXT | Enum: build / buy / automate |
| tool_or_approach | TEXT | The specific tool or approach chosen. |

| is_core_capability | INTEGER | Boolean. Is this capability a source of competitive differentiation? |
| review_date | DATE | When this decision should be revisited. |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Build/buy/automate framework** (from the textbook): Build only what is core and differentiated. Buy for commodities where a good tool exists. Automate everything that is repetitive and rule-based. Never buy what you should build; never build what you can buy.

---

### BoardMember

An entry in the founder's mental board of directors. A curated set of advisors, mentors, or intellectual influences the founder consults for perspective.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |

| status | TEXT | Enum: identified / exploring / active |
| created_at | DATETIME | Auto |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Auto |

**Synergy types**: Audience (shared target customer), Tech (shared infrastructure or tools), Distribution (shared channel or platform), Content (content from one business builds authority for another), Supplier (shared vendor relationships or negotiating power).

---

### WeeklyReview

The self-accountability log. The CEO discipline that most solo founders skip.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto |

---

## Business Lifecycle

The Business entity's `stage` field is managed by a COMPILER state machine. Stages represent meaningful inflection points, not arbitrary labels. The compiler enforces transition criteria.

```
Idea
  |-- (value proposition + target market defined) --> Validated
  |-- (manual: kill it) --> Killed

Validated
  |-- (first paying customer OR LOI signed) --> Building
  |-- (manual: kill it) --> Killed

Building
  |-- (MRR > 0 OR 3+ closed won clients) --> Active
  |-- (manual: pause) --> Paused
  |-- (manual: kill it) --> Killed

Active
  |-- (MRR > $5K OR 10+ closed clients AND systems documented) --> Scaling
  |-- (manual: pause) --> Paused
  |-- (founder exits) --> Exited

Scaling
  |-- (founder exits) --> Exited
  |-- (manual: pause) --> Paused

Paused
  |-- (manual: resume) --> (previous stage)
  |-- (manual: kill it) --> Killed

Exited / Killed  [terminal states]
```

**AI gate checks at each transition**:

- **Idea → Validated**: AI checks that StrategicPosition has a non-empty value_proposition and target_market, and that at least one SalesContact exists with notes indicating a real customer conversation.
- **Validated → Building**: AI checks that a pricing model exists in the Business description and that the LTV estimate in at least one SalesContact is > 0.
- **Building → Active**: AI checks FinancialSnapshot for revenue > 0 or SalesContact for at least 3 closed_won entries.
- **Active → Scaling**: AI checks FinancialSnapshot for consistent revenue (2+ snapshots), OperationsAudit overall_score < 20 (reasonably systemized), and at least one DollarAudit entry with transfer_status = transferred.

---

## AI Discipline Advisors

Seven AI_SERVICE actions, one per MBA discipline. Each advisor receives the relevant entity data for the target business and returns a structured briefing.

All advisors operate under the Cattle Dog Principle: they surface, flag, and recommend — they never decide. The founder reads the briefing and acts.

### strategy_advisor

Analyzes the StrategicPosition record for the business. Returns: current moat assessment, top 2-3 market risks given the competitive landscape, recommended next move to strengthen the primary moat, one question the founder should be asking that they are not.

Prompt framing: Uses the four-moat model (reputation, system, network, content), the concept of compounding advantages, and the principle that strategy is about choosing what NOT to do as much as what to do.

### operations_advisor

Reads the OperationsAudit and all DollarAudit entries for the business. Returns: the single highest-leverage bottleneck to address first, a specific AI or system recommendation to address it, current $20/$200 ratio analysis (hours spent at each tier), top 3 $20-tier tasks to transfer immediately.

Prompt framing: Uses the six-bottleneck model, the $20/$200 Audit framework, and the self-running business ideal — a business that can generate revenue without the founder's daily involvement.

### finance_advisor

Reads the most recent FinancialSnapshot. Returns: unit economics diagnosis (LTV:CAC, gross margin, MRR trajectory), identification of any red-flag metrics against the textbook thresholds, a pricing recommendation if gross margin is below 50%, cash runway assessment and recommended action.

Prompt framing: Uses value-based pricing (never hourly), the 6-month runway rule, the LTV:CAC target of > 3, and the principle that pricing is a strategic decision not an accounting one.

### marketing_advisor

Reads all MarketingAsset and ContentPipelineItem records for the business. Returns: current position on the authority ladder (Unknown/Aware/Credible/Authoritative/Referred) based on asset mix, gap analysis (what content types are missing for the next ladder stage), top 3 recommended next content moves, platform concentration risk assessment.

Prompt framing: Uses the authority ladder, the content-to-client pipeline model, and the principle that authority-first marketing compounds over time while paid advertising does not.

### sales_advisor

Reads all SalesContact records for the business. Returns: pipeline health score (conversion rates by stage), stale contact list (contacts with next_action_date in the past), top 3 follow-up actions ranked by LTV potential, referral architecture assessment (what % of pipeline is referral-sourced).

Prompt framing: Uses the sales conversation architecture (qualify → diagnose → prescribe), the qualification gate concept (time-box prospects aggressively), and the referral flywheel (closed_won clients become the source of the next closed_won).

### tech_advisor

Reads all AIStackDecision records for the business. Returns: total monthly tool spend, core-capability risk assessment (is the founder paying for something competitive that should be built?), dependency concentration risk (too many critical capabilities on one vendor), top 3 automation opportunities not yet captured in the stack.

Prompt framing: Uses the build/buy/automate decision matrix, the principle that AI tools chosen for convenience can become strategic liabilities, and the Sovereign Intelligence frame (the founder's judgment about the AI stack is itself a $200/hr activity).

### leadership_advisor

Reads the last 4-8 WeeklyReview entries. Returns: energy trend (is the founder burning out or recovering?), CEO-time ratio (are they spending enough hours on $200 work?), pattern identification (recurring learning themes, recurring focus areas that never resolve), one accountability question for the coming week.

Prompt framing: Uses the CEO discipline model, the energy management principle (output quality degrades before the founder notices it), and the mental board of directors concept.

### portfolio_synergy_detector

Reads all Business records plus their associated StrategicPosition, MarketingAsset, and AIStackDecision records across the entire portfolio. Returns: top 3-5 unexploited synergies ranked by estimated value, for each synergy: which two businesses are involved, what type it is, and a specific action to begin exploiting it this week.

Prompt framing: Uses the Compounding Operator model (assets that serve multiple businesses simultaneously are exponentially more valuable than assets that serve one), the four synergy types (audience, tech, distribution, content), and the principle that portfolio thinking is itself a $200/hr CEO activity.

## Deterministic Actions (IMPL stubs)

### export_business_report

Generates a full business snapshot as a Markdown document including: business overview, current StrategicPosition, latest OperationsAudit scores, most recent FinancialSnapshot, MarketingAsset summary, SalesContact pipeline summary, active AIStackDecision table, last 4 WeeklyReview entries. Output is written to `~/Documents/NovaSynMBA/{business_name}_report_{date}.md`.

### calculate_ltv_cac

Given a FinancialSnapshot's revenue, CAC, and LTV fields, computes ltv_cac_ratio = LTV ÷ CAC, then writes the result back to the record. Also writes a health flag: healthy (≥ 3), watch (2–3), critical (< 2).

### generate_pitch_deck_outline

Generates a deterministic Markdown outline for a 10-slide pitch narrative using the business's StrategicPosition and FinancialSnapshot data. Slides: Problem, Solution, Market Size, Unique Advantage, Business Model, Traction, Unit Economics, Team (founder), Ask, Vision. Output written to `~/Documents/NovaSynMBA/{business_name}_pitch_outline.md`.

### import_csv_contacts

---

## Feature Requests for Agicore

Features still needed for NovaSyn MBA's full feature set. Each has a `## TODO(agicore)` comment in `novasyn_mba.agi`.

### 1. ROUTER Codegen

**Needed for**: AI department routing — selecting the correct discipline advisor based on the user's current tab or stated question, without hand-coding a dispatch switch in Rust.

**Proposed syntax**: `ROUTER advisor_router { MATCH business_tab { "strategy" -> strategy_advisor, "operations" -> operations_advisor, ... } }`

### 2. Cross-Entity AI Actions

**Needed for**: The `portfolio_synergy_detector` action, which must aggregate Business + StrategicPosition + MarketingAsset + AIStackDecision records across multiple businesses simultaneously before constructing the AI prompt.

**Current workaround**: The Rust IMPL stub hand-joins the entities and passes the result as a summary string. Works but loses type safety.

### 3. Kanban VIEW Layout Type

**Needed for**: Content Pipeline (Idea/Drafted/Reviewed/Published columns) and Sales Pipeline (Prospect/Qualified/Proposal/Closed Won/Closed Lost/Referred columns).

**Proposed syntax**: `VIEW content_pipeline { ENTITY ContentPipelineItem LAYOUT kanban GROUP_BY status }`

### 4. PDF/Rich Export ACTION Pattern

**Needed for**: `export_business_report` — a formatted PDF with entity tables, metric charts, and structured advisor-briefing sections.

**Proposed syntax**: `ACTION export_business_report { IMPL "export_business_report" PATTERN pdf_export }`

### 5. COMPILER State Machine for Business.stage

**Needed for**: Enforcing lifecycle gate criteria at the DSL level — e.g. preventing a Business from advancing to "Validated" unless a StrategicPosition with value_proposition and target_market exists. Currently handled by the `advance_business_stage` IMPL action with manual validation in Rust.

**Proposed syntax**: See grammar.md COMPILER section. Needs multi-entity condition support (e.g. `REQUIRES StrategicPosition.value_proposition IS NOT NULL`).

**Proposed pattern**: A standard IMPL action type that can invoke a Tauri-native PDF renderer and write output to the filesystem with a file picker dialog.
